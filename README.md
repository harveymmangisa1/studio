# paeasybooks: Your All-in-One Business Management System

paeasybooks is an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to be the central nervous system for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It combines robust inventory management with a full double-entry financial accounting system, inspired by industry leaders like Xero, QuickBooks, and Zoho Books.

## Vision

The vision for paeasybooks is to provide a powerful, intuitive, and scalable solution that empowers businesses to manage their core operations seamlessly. This includes:

*   **Inventory & Stock Management:** Real-time stock tracking, SKU management, and stock movement auditing.
*   **Financial Accounting:** A complete double-entry system with a Chart of Accounts, General Ledger, and automated transaction recording.
*   **Sales & Invoicing:** Professional invoicing, payment tracking, and accounts receivable management.
*   **Expense Tracking:** Simple and effective expense logging and categorization.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Dynamic dashboards and in-depth financial reports like Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and AR Aging.
*   **Team Management:** Secure, role-based access control to ensure team members only see what they need to.

The platform is built on a modern, reliable technology stack including Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS.

## Current Status: MVP Complete

The project has successfully reached the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** stage. All core features required for an initial launch are functionally implemented, including:

*   Multi-tenant architecture with complete data isolation.
*   User authentication and role-based access.
*   Core modules for Inventory, Sales, Expenses, and Financial Accounting.
*   A dynamic dashboard providing key business insights.

The application is now a functional platform ready for user acceptance testing (UAT). The next critical step is to build a comprehensive testing suite to ensure stability and reliability before a public launch.
